Data analysis was performed on two different .csv files. The different python scripts can be found in the PyBank Directory and the PyPoll Directory. For the analysis, the .csv file is loaded into the script, the main.py script performs an analysis and prints a report to the console, and finally writes the report to a .txt file.


For this project using gitbash I made (2) new directories. PyBank and PyRoll. Then made (2) folders in each directory called Resources and Analysis. I then downloaded the necessarn .csv files for the project and place them in thier perspective Resource folders. Then created a new file called Main.py this is where i made my script to run the analysis. 

In this project data analysis was performed on (2) different .csv files. They are located in the resources folder. 

I first created a path to open and read the .csv files. 

Then wrote script to return various information from the .csv files. This script is in the main.py file in the resource folder.
This script performs analysis and prints a report to the console and finally writes the report to a .txt file. This .txt file is located in the analysis folder.
